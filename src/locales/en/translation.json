    "heading": "Frequently Asked <span class='marker-slanted'>Questions</span>",
    "q1": {
      "question": "Is BentoPDF really free?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. All tools on BentoPDF are 100% free to use, with no file limits, no sign-ups, and no watermarks. We believe everyone deserves access to simple, powerful PDF tools without a paywall."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Are my files secure? Where are they processed?",
      "answer": "Your files are as secure as possible because they <strong>never leave your computer</strong>. All processing happens directly in your web browser (client-side). We never upload your files to a server, so you maintain complete privacy and control over your documents."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Does it work on Mac, Windows, and Mobile?",
      "answer": "Yes! Since BentoPDF runs entirely in your browser, it works on any operating system with a modern web browser, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Is BentoPDF GDPR compliant?",
      "answer": "Yes. BentoPDF is fully GDPR compliant. Since all file processing happens locally in your browser and we never collect or transmit your files to any server, we have no access to your data. This ensures you are always in control of your documents."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "Do you store or track any of my files?",
      "answer": "No. We never store, track, or log your files. Everything you do on BentoPDF happens in your browser memory and disappears once you close the page. There are no uploads, no history logs, and no servers involved."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "What makes BentoPDF different from other PDF tools?",
      "answer": "Most PDF tools upload your files to a server for processing. BentoPDF never does that. We use secure, modern web technology to process your files directly in your browser. This means faster performance, stronger privacy, and complete peace of mind."
    },
    "q7": {
      "question": "How does browser-based processing keep me safe?",
      "answer": "By running entirely inside your browser, BentoPDF ensures that your files never leave your device. This eliminates the risks of server hacks, data breaches, or unauthorized access. Your files remain yours—always."
    },
    "q8": {
      "question": "Do you use cookies or analytics to track me?",
      "answer": "We care about your privacy. BentoPDF does not track personal information. We use <a href=\"https://simpleanalytics.com\" class=\"text-indigo-400 hover:underline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Simple Analytics</a> solely to see anonymous visit counts. This means we can know how many users visit our site, but <strong>we never know who you are</strong>. Simple Analytics is fully GDPR-compliant and respects your privacy."
    }
  },
  "faqPage": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Have questions? We've got answers. Here are some of the most common things people ask about BentoPDF.",
    "q1": {
      "question": "Are my files safe and private?",
      "answer": "<strong>Absolutely.</strong> This is the most important feature of BentoPDF. All processing happens 100% locally in your web browser. Your files are never uploaded to any server, which means we—or anyone else—can never see them. Your privacy is guaranteed."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Is BentoPDF really free? What's the catch?",
      "answer": "Yes, it's completely free, and there's no catch. There are no hidden fees, no subscription plans, no usage limits, and no premium-only features. We believe essential tools should be accessible to everyone."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Do I need an internet connection to use the tools?",
      "answer": "After you load the website for the first time, most tools will work completely offline! Because all the processing libraries are loaded into your browser, you can disconnect from the internet and continue to merge, split, compress, and edit your PDFs securely. Some niche tools that require external data (like Markdown to PDF with web images) may need a connection."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Are there any file size or usage limitations?",
      "answer": "No, we do not impose any artificial limits on file size, the number of files, or how many times you can use a tool. The only practical limitation is the processing power and memory of your own computer, as very large or complex files may take longer to process."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "Why did my PDF fail to process?",
      "answer": "Failures are rare but can happen for a few reasons:",
      "reasons": {
        "0": "The PDF might be corrupted or not compliant with standard specifications.",
        "1": "The file could be encrypted with a password you don't have. Please use our Decrypt tool first.",
        "2": "The file might be a special \"XFA\" or dynamic form-based PDF, which some of our tools cannot process."
      }
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "Do you track my activity on BentoPDF?",
      "answer": "We care about your privacy. BentoPDF does not track personal information. We use <a href=\"https://simpleanalytics.com\" class=\"text-indigo-400 hover:underline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Simple Analytics</a> solely to see anonymous visit counts. This means we can know how many users visit our site, but <strong>we never know who you are</strong>. Simple Analytics is fully GDPR-compliant and respects your privacy."
    },
    "q7": {
      "question": "What technology does BentoPDF use?",
      "answer": "BentoPDF is built on the power of modern web technologies. We primarily use JavaScript libraries like <strong>PDF-lib.js</strong> and <strong>PDFKit.js</strong> that are compiled to run efficiently in your browser via WebAssembly. This allows for powerful, server-like processing without your data ever leaving your machine."
